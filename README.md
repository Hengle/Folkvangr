## Story Synopsis
The story begins in an isolated hamlet bordered by a dense forest.  When the local forester doesn’t return from an ill-advised hunting foray in the woods, a search party gathers to look for him.  The general opinion is that the forester is probably already dead.  The villagers eventually give up and turn back, but his half-sister continues deeper into the heart of the forest to continue searching.  

The introductory trailer is designed to establish the characters and setting for a more in-depth game production, but the story will be self-contained.  The tone is intended to be ominous, mysterious, and claustrophobic.  The characters will experience some rather harrowing and visceral ordeals as they struggle to get out of the forest alive.

## Production Goals and Art Style
The first goal is to produce an animated short/trailer.  This can then be used to pitch a crowdfunding campaign for a longer cinematic trailer or an RPG style video game, depending on the amount of funds raised. 

The style and medium will be determined by the art team, but will likely employ hybrid techniques.  Possible visuals references include the illustrations of Arthur Rackham, Eyvind Earle, and Brian Froud, with a mix of Grimm’s Fairy Tales and Old Norse and Icelandic Sagas.  The closest video game reference examples would probably be Baldur's Gate, The Banner Saga, and Telltale games. 

Emphasis will be placed on character animation, cinematography, story, and visual stylization. 

## Production Status
The project is currently in the pre-vis stage.  There is a script, some concept art, breakdowns, and documentation that can be used for reference.  However, I am open to alternative suggestions, designs, or input from others. 

The project is being self-financed until a pitch can be made on Kickstarter.  Nobody is expected to work for free or to commit long-term without compensation.  If the campaign goes through, any funds that don't go towards taxes or necessary expenses will be used directly for hiring.

Discussions about establishing a formal pipeline will begin as the size of the team grows and production ramps up.

## Project Breakdown
The projected length of the promotional trailer is one or two minutes.

Depending on the size of the team and the budget, production of the short promotional trailer is anticipated to take around eight months to develop. Since unexpected production delays always happen, it’s probably realistic to add an extra few months to that number.

## Game Development
Full-time production would begin following the crowdfunding campaign, assuming that doesn’t fail dismally.

The crowdfunding goal is estimated around $8,000 to produce a trailer, or $10,000-35,000 to create a game alpha version.  The ultimate goal is to crowdfund the game in two or three incremental stretches.  Each campaign will increase in funding scope according to how the development is  progressing, and what assets and features are being produced.  Milestone markers and community updates would be scheduled to occur at regular intervals during development.  A conservative estimate for a 7-10 person team producing a full game would cost in the range of $300,000-450,000+, and likely take two or more years to finish. 

The game will be an RPG with a narrative storyline and unique game mechanics.  It will not be a full open world, but hopefully the budget will allow for some limited exploration.

At this time, Unity is the preferred game engine.  Other middleware options may be considered depending on the preferences of the technical director.  The final decision on the game engine will be determined before the crowdfunding campaign.

## Risk Mitigation

At this point, attempting to produce an entire alpha game is impractical until a trailer is ready and showing promising signs of being funded.  The plan is to focus on breaking the project down into smaller chunks so that the goals are achievable.  This way contributors can make smaller commitments, and there is less of a loss if the project doesn't work out.

If things progress well with the trailer and networking, preliminary discussions will begin for assembling a technical lead, director, management crew, and game development team.  The team commitments will need to be finalized several months before the crowdfunding campaign begins.

If the fundraising campaign doesn't meet the first goal, efforts will be made to try and develop an animated short instead, which would clock in at around seven to twelve minutes.
