RPG Game Design Project

## Story Synopsis
The story is set in an isolated hamlet bordered by a dense forest.  There are tales that the gloomy woods are haunted, and that dangerous creatures and enchanted spirits prowl when night falls.   Many of the village denizens refuse to approach the outer fringe of trees out of fear their souls might be trapped by the supernatural elements within.  

When the local forester doesn’t return for several days after one of his ill-advised hunting forays deep in the woods, his half-sister goes to search for him.  The general opinion is that the forester is probably already dead, and she is risking her life for nothing: neither one of them are going to come back alive.

The tone of the story is intended to be ominous, mysterious, and claustrophobic, inspired by the illustrations of Arthur Rackham, Eyvind Earle, and Brian Froud, with a mix of Grimm’s Fairy Tales and Old Norse and Icelandic Sagas.  

## Production Goals and Art Style
The first goal is to produce an animated short/trailer.  This can then be used to pitch a crowdfunding campaign for a longer cinematic trailer or an RPG style video game, depending on the amount of funds raised. 

If any animation studios or game distribution companies are willing to offer to help produce and distribute the IP, those options will be considered.  However, independent crowdfunded production is presumed to be the more likely scenario.

The style and medium will be determined by the art team, but I am open to hybrid techniques.  I’d be interested in integrating the hand drawn look of 2D with 3D pipeline techniques, if it can be done in a timely and cost efficient manner.  Otherwise, 3D is the industry default.

Emphasis will be placed on character animation, cinematography, and visual stylization.

## Project Breakdown
The projected length of the promotional trailer is two minutes, while a finished short would clock in at around seven to twelve minutes.  At this point I’m not worrying about the logistics of producing an entire game or series until a trailer is ready and showing promising signs of being funded.

Depending on the size of the team and the budget, production of the short promotional trailer is anticipated to take around six to eight months to develop.  Since unexpected production delays always happen, it’s probably realistic to add an extra few months to that number.

Full-time production would begin following the crowdfunding campaign, assuming that doesn’t fail dismally.

## Contributing
I try to keep realistic expectations for what can be achieved with the available resources.  Without sufficient planning, support, or funding, the odds of completing a long-term project are slim.  

Unless certain key factors fall into place and I am able to raise funds to fairly compensate the team contributors, I will not ask other people to pour their time and energy into a high-risk project. 

At this time, I am mainly looking to find potential collaborators who might be interested in the project.  There are no formal commitments or obligatory contracts to sign until the project is financed.  Any form of help will be accredited.

I believe that the best ideas are usually the product of many different people contributing their creativity and ideas.  Hopefully that will prove true for this project.  

## Application
Please send a cover letter with some of the things you might be interested in working on.  

Professional quality standards apply.  Good communication skills are probably the most important factor, as much of the work may be remote. 

Main positions will likely go to those with the most qualifications and experience, but I try not to flatly deny people who are willing to help out in some way.  There may be assistant positions available during certain points of the production.

Thanks for reading this far.  If there are any questions about the project, feel free to contact me by email.  I generally try to reply within 24 hours.
