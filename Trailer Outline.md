# Trailer

## Trailer without Dialogue
This trailer would focus on showing the perspective of one of the main characters.  The technical scope would be reigned in, making this option the most practical to produce with the limited resources available.  

The story sequence takes place before the key catalyst event, so the story will not be drastically affected if slight changes are made to the existing script.  This leaves a little more room for other contributors to add in their own creative input.

## Trailer with Dialogue
This trailer provides more characterization and context that sets up the full game story, but it requires more rigging, animation, modeling, and graphical detail.  It would focus on the two protagonists and would require dialogue.  

For technical reasons, it probably makes more sense to just integrate the dialogue within the game sequences, or as 2D cutscenes.

## Alternatives

### Trailer from Different Character Perspective, No Dialogue
This could be used to tell the story of the missing peddler who vanished a few months before the events of the main game, but it doesn't position the promotional campaign very well if it doesn't feature the main characters.  This trailer would be set in the ruins rather than the forest. 

### Game Cinematic Trailer
This trailer would showcase some of the more interesting locations from the entire game.  Creating assets, animation, and production quality rendering would be challenging on a short timeline, and would require more resources than are currently available.

### 7-12 Minute Animated Short
The graphics and rigging technicalities make this better suited to a small independent production with funding.  A funded animation could features dialogue and multiple characters, or other technical areas and art styles. 

### Notes
The scenes should have very visceral action, no shaky cam or fast cuts.  See Little Nightmares and the camera work in The Revenant.  There should be a sense that the character is defeated mentally and physically, so it is more satisfying when they come back and triumph.  

### Title Sequence
Slow animation of rune letters rorating one by one into recognizable alphabet letters.
