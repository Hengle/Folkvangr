# Trailer

## Trailer without Dialogue
The script would be edited down to be shorter and focus on one character and a creature stalking them, likely ending on a tense cliffhanger.  This is the most practical trailer to produce.  Reducing the number of characters down to one would allow for more emphasis on one model.  The sequence takes place before the key catalyst event, so it technically will not impact the story if slight changes are made to the existing script.  This would leave a little more room for other contributors to add in their own creative input.

Add tension by having the lantern flicker and nearly go out.

## Trailer with Dialogue
This makes the most sense in context of the full game story, but it requires more rigging, animation, modeling, and graphical detail.  It might work better in 2D.

## Alternatives

### Trailer from Different Character Perspective
This could be used to tell the story of the missing peddler, but it doesn't set up the promotional campaign well if it doesn't have the main characters.  It would avoid the need for dialogue.

### Game Cinematic Trailer
This trailer would cover scenes from the entire game, but creating assets, animation, and rendering would be challenging

### 7-12 Minute Animated Short
This would be a possible substitute if the crowdfunding campaign does reach the first goal.  Some of the graphics and rigging technicalities make this better suited to a small independent production with funding.
