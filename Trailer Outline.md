# Trailer

## Trailer without Dialogue
The original script would need to be edited down to be shorter and focus on one character, likely ending on a tense cliffhanger.  This is the most practical trailer to produce.  

The story sequence takes place before the key catalyst event, so it technically will not impact the story if slight changes are made to the existing script.  This would leave a little more room for other contributors to add in their own creative input.

## Trailer with Dialogue
This makes the most sense in context of the full game story, but it requires more rigging, animation, modeling, and graphical detail.  It would focus on the two protagonists and would require dialogue.  The dialogue might work better integrated within the game, or as 2D cutscenes.

## Alternatives

### Trailer from Different Character Perspective, No Dialogue
This could be used to tell the story of the missing peddler who vanished a few months before the events of the main game, but it doesn't position the promotional campaign very well if it doesn't feature the main characters.  This trailer would be set in the ruins more than the forest. 

### Game Cinematic Trailer
This trailer would cover scenes from the entire game.  Creating assets, animation, and production quality rendering would be challenging on a short timeline.

### 7-12 Minute Animated Short
Some of the graphics and rigging technicalities make this better suited to a small independent production with funding.  A funded animation could features dialogue and multiple characters, or other technical areas and art styles. 

### Title Sequence
Slow animation of rune letters rorating one by one into recognizable alphabet letters.

### Notes
The scenes should have very visceral action, no shaky cam or fast cuts.  See Little Nightmares and the camera work in The Revenant.  There should be a sense that the character is defeated mentally and physically, so it is more satisfying when they come back and triumph.
