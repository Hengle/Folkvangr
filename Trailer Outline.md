### Alternatives

#### Trailer with Dialogue
This makes the most sense in context of the story, but it requires more rigging, animation, and graphical detail.  It might work better in 2D.

#### Trailer without Dialogue
The script would be edited down to be shorter and focus on one character and a creature stalking them, likely ending on a tense cliffhanger.  This is the most practical trailer to produce.

#### Trailer from Different Character Perspective
This could be used to tell the story of the missing peddler, but it doesn't set up the promotional campaign well if it doesn't have the main characters.  It would avoid the need for dialogue.

#### 7-12 Minute Animated Short
This would be a possible substitute if the crowdfunding campaign does to reach the first goal.  It is technically very complex.

#### Game Cinematic Trailer
This trailer would cover scenes from the entire game, but creating assets, animation, and rendering would be challenging
