## "Ruins" Trailer
This narrative takes place sequentially after the events of the first trailer.  This was originally planned as the main trailer, as it provides more characterization and context that sets up the full game story.  However, it would have required a lot of additional rigging, animation, modeling, and graphical detail.  

For technical reasons, it probably makes more sense to just integrate the complex interactions and dialogue bits within the game sequences, or as 2D cutscenes.

This might be a possible option for a second animated short if the fundraising goal for a game alpha is not met.
