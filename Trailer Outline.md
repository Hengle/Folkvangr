## "Discovery" Trailer
This trailer provides more characterization and context that sets up the full game story, but it requires more rigging, animation, modeling, and graphical detail.  It would focus on the two protagonists and would likely require interactions and dialogue.  

For technical reasons, it probably makes more sense to just integrate the dialogue bits within the game sequences, or as 2D cutscenes.

This might be a possible option for a second animated short if the fundraising goal for a game alpha is not met.
