### Synopsis
The story focuses on the deuteragonist Regin as she searches for her missing brother who has vanished in the forest.  The events take place over the course of five days.  The timeline will be condensed with a series of atmospheric montage shots, with the primary action of the story taking place on the fourth day.

Since there isn't any dialogue or backstory provided in the limited scope of the trailer, the character will need to be relatable through her actions, motives, and expressions.  The goal is to make the audience feel invested in seeing her overcome struggles.  

The character arc focuses on how the character reacts under stress in a dire situation. Despite facing a series of obstacles and low points, she displays determination and resolve to continue searching.  Her refusal to give up is what makes her story more compelling.

### Title Sequence
The current logo mockup is based on a traditional Norse motif called the gripping beast.  It might get changed to a World Tree motif depending how the 3D model turns out.  The title will display the logo with rune letters rorating one by one into recognizable alphabet letters.  

### Credits
There might be a brief post credits scene teasing the game, if there is time leftover to squeeze in the Ruins scene.  Links to a crowdfunding campaign or website might be recommended.

### Experimental Animation Style Ideas
If possible, I'd like to preserve the hand-drawn appeal of traditional illustration while implementing the efficiency of 3D models.  It might be interesting to use 2D backgrounds with 3D character models that are partially hand painted around the edges to give a unique visual look to the animation.  

The lines would look like the loose sketch lines illustrators often make.  The experimental effect can be interpreted as a reflection of the character's fraying mental state at the time of the events in the story.  The flickering edges would also match the light of the lantern and add to the suspense of the forest being a sort of living entity.  It would add more subtle movement, life, and visual interest to the environment.

It might be possible to automate a script that would create the lines, or else composite the effect in postproduction using some kind of filter, render pass, or matte, maybe using a lingering onion skinning effect.

### "Ruins" Trailer
This narrative takes place sequentially after the events of the first trailer.  This was originally planned as the main trailer, as it provides more characterization and context that sets up the full game story.  However, it would have required a lot of additional rigging, animation, modeling, and graphical detail.  

For technical reasons, it probably makes more sense to just integrate the complex interactions and dialogue bits within the game sequences, or as 2D cutscenes.

This might be a possible option for a second animated short if the fundraising goal for a game alpha is not met.  Many of the existing assets and rigged models could be reused.
