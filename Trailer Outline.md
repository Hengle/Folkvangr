## "Search" Trailer 
This trailer would focus on showing the perspective of one of the main characters.  The technical scope would be reigned in, cutting out dialogue and reducing the scrrentime of thesecond character, making this option the most practical to produce with the limited resources available.  

The sequence takes place before the key catalyst event in the game timeline, so the story will not be drastically affected if slight changes are made to the existing script.  This leaves a little more room for other contributors to add in their own creative input.

## "Discovery" Trailer
This trailer provides more characterization and context that sets up the full game story, but it requires more rigging, animation, modeling, and graphical detail.  It would focus on the two protagonists and would likely require interactions and dialogue.  

For technical reasons, it probably makes more sense to just integrate the dialogue bits within the game sequences, or as 2D cutscenes.

This might be a possible option for a second animated short if the fundraising goal for a game alpha is not met.
