### Synopsis
The story primarily follows Regin's perspective as she searches for her missing brother who has vanished in the forest.  The events take place over the course of five or seven days.  The timeline will be condensed with a series of atmospheric montage shots, with the primary action of the story taking place on the fourth day.

Since there isn't any dialogue or extensive backstory provided in the limited scope of the trailer, the character will need to be relatable through her actions, motives, and expressions.  The goal is to make the audience feel invested in seeing her overcome obstacles.  Despite facing a series of struggles, she displays determination and resolve to continue searching.

### Title Sequence
Folkvangr is a working title for the project.  When a better name is finalized, the title logo will be created.

If animated, the title will display the logo with superimposed rune letters rotating one by one into recognizable alphabet letters.  The background will probably involve some kind of knotwork motif.

The previous logo mockup was based on a traditional Norse motif called a gripping beast.  It will probably get changed to a world tree motif, ouroboros, raven, or an alternate pretzel-beastie design.

### Experimental Animation Style Ideas
If possible with the existing time constraints and budget, it would be nice to try out an experimental technique or a hybrid art style.  I'm most interested in finding a way to impliment an illustrative/line art style without compromising the efficiency of 3D models, but other suggestions are welcomed.
