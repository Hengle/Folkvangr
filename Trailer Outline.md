# Trailer

## Trailer without Dialogue
This trailer would focus on showing the perspective of one of the main characters.  The technical scope would be reigned in, making this option the most practical to produce with the limited resources available.  

The sequence takes place before the key catalyst event in the game timeline, so the story will not be drastically affected if slight changes are made to the existing script.  This leaves a little more room for other contributors to add in their own creative input.

## Trailer with Dialogue
This trailer provides more characterization and context that sets up the full game story, but it requires more rigging, animation, modeling, and graphical detail.  It would focus on the two protagonists and would likely require interactions and dialogue.  

For technical reasons, it probably makes more sense to just integrate the dialogue bits within the game sequences, or as 2D cutscenes.

### Title Sequence
Slow animation of rune letters rorating one by one into recognizable alphabet letters.  The logo is based on a Norse gripping beast motif.

## Alternatives

### Trailer from Different Character Perspective, No Dialogue
This could be used to tell the story of the missing peddler who vanished a few months before the events of the main game, but it doesn't position the promotional campaign very well if it doesn't feature the main characters.  This trailer would be set in the ruins rather than the forest. 

### Game Cinematic Trailer
This trailer would showcase some of the more interesting locations from the entire game.  Creating assets, animation, and production quality rendering would be challenging on a short timeline, and would require more resources than are currently available.

### Deathbed Scene
This more dramatic scene would set up the backstory of the two main characters in the game without the need for exposition or flashbacks later on.  Not sure this would be a subject most other people would want to work on.

### 7-12 Minute Animated Short
The graphics and rigging technicalities make this better suited to a small independent production with funding.  A funded animation could features dialogue and multiple characters, or other technical areas and art styles.
