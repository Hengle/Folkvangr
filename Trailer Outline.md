### Synopsis
The story focuses on the deuteragonist Regin as she searches for her missing brother who has vanished in the forest.  The events take place over the course of five days.  The timeline will be condensed with a series of atmospheric montage shots, with the primary action of the story taking place on the fourth day.

### Title Sequence
The logo is based on a traditional Norse motif called the gripping beast.  The title will display the logo with rune letters rorating one by one into recognizable alphabet letters.  

### Experimental Animation Style Ideas
It is always a risk anda challenge to try something different in order to push the boundaries of modern technology and art.  I'd like to preserve the hand-drawn appeal of traditional animation while implementing the efficiency of 3D models.  It might be interesting to use 2D backgrounds with 3D character models that are partially hand painted around the edges to give a unique visual look to the animation.  3D animation tends to look very smooth, and lacks the characteristic flicker of frames seen in stop-motion or hand-drawn animation.

The lines would look like the loose sketch lines illustrators often make.  The experimental effect can be interpreted as a reflection of the character's fraying mental state at the time of the events in the story.  The flickering edges would also match the light of the lantern and add to the suspense of the forest being a sort of living entity.

It might be possible to automate a script that would create the lines via a filter in a render pass or video composite matte, maybe using a lingering onion skinning effect.

## "Ruins" Trailer
This narrative takes place sequentially after the events of the first trailer.  This was originally planned as the main trailer, as it provides more characterization and context that sets up the full game story.  However, it would have required a lot of additional rigging, animation, modeling, and graphical detail.  

For technical reasons, it probably makes more sense to just integrate the complex interactions and dialogue bits within the game sequences, or as 2D cutscenes.

This might be a possible option for a second animated short if the fundraising goal for a game alpha is not met.
