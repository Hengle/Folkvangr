*The trailer should be quick.  30 seconds max.  Atmospheric, Non-linear.  It will use some of the scenes that are listed in the script for the animated short.*

### Music

Shot 1:  The main character raises a lantern to illuminate the darkness around her.  She is small and alone in the middle of a forest.  
Fade out.

Cycle through a series of cinematic shots of the protagonist searching the forest.  Emphasize the environments and exploration aspect.  There will be a very loose sense of a story, but the visuals are the main focus of a teaser trailer.

Speed up editing, then cut to the title.  

Title Overlay Credits

The music should end with the title, so that the post credits scene is silent aside from the sound effects.

### Cliffhanger Teaser

Shot of the protagonist running and looking over her shoulder at the patch of trees behind her.  Pause for dramatic tension on the establishing shot on treeline.  The creature bursts out of the trees.  

Final shot of her being chased.

Sharp cut to end of teaser with blurb about crowdfunding and misc. website links.
