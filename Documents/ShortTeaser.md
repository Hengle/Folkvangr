*The trailer should be quick.  30 seconds max.  Atmospheric, Non-linear.  It will use the scenes from the animated short.*

### Music

Shot of character raising lantern alone in the middle of a forest.  
Fade out.

Cycle through a series of the best cinematic shots of protagonist searching forest.  Emphasize the exploration aspect.

Speed up editing, then cut to Title.  

Title Overlay Credits

The music should end with the title, so that the post credits scene is silent aside from the sound effects.

### Cliffhanger Teaser

Shot of the protagonist running and looking over her shoulder at the patch of trees behind her.  Pause for dramatic tension on the establishing shot on treeline.  The creature bursts out of the trees.  

Shot of her being chased.
