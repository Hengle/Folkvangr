*The trailer should be quick.  30 seconds max.  Atmospheric, Non-linear.  It will use some of the scenes that are listed in the [script](https://github.com/jcongerkallas1/Folkvangr/blob/master/Documents/script.mb) for the animated short.*

### Teaser Part 1

Music begins to play.

Shot 1:  The main character raises a lantern to illuminate the darkness around her.  She appears small and alone in the middle of an endless forest.  

Fade out.

Cycle through a series of cinematic shots of the protagonist searching the forest.  Emphasize the environments and exploration aspect.  There will be a very loose sense of a story, but the visuals are the main focus of a teaser trailer.

Speed up editing, then cut to the title.  

Title Overlay Credits

The music should end with the title, so that the post credits scene is silent aside from the sound effects.

### Teaser Part 2: Cliffhanger

The protagonist is running when she bursts into a clearing area, where she pauses to catch her breath look over her shoulder at the patch of trees behind her.  Pause for dramatic tension on the establishing shot of the treeline.  Rustling and snapping branches can be heard.  The creature suddenly bursts out of the trees.  

Final cutaway shot pans to follow the dynamic action as the protagonist resumes running as if her life depended on it, dodging branches and jumping over fallen logs.  The creature starts to bound after her at a much faster rate than she can sprint.

Sharp cut to end of teaser.  Info about the crowdfunding page and misc. website links will be displayed.

As Regin is searching the forest, she needs to find a temporary shelter to rest.  It is raining and getting dark.
She finds a slight hill where a tree’s roots naturally form a shallow overhang over a partially hidden rock.

She stops to curl up in a basin between the roots, but the ground is hard and the roots are fairly uncomfortable so she can’t really get any sleep.  The next morning her neck is stiff from using a knobby  root as a pillow.  She is also cold because she didn’t bother to light a fire the night before, since the kindling was too damp.

She notices inscriptions on the stone she is leaning against. She scratches away a small section of moss with her knife.  There are more inscriptions than expected, leading beneath the moss and vines that encrust the stone.  She steps back to look at the back wall of the overhang, which looks like nothing more than a mass cluster of roots and vines.  However, on closer inspection, a rock surface can be glimpsed.  She scrapes the lichen aside with her knife, and reveals a large flat rock covered in ancient writing,

The engraved stone is slightly taller than her, and about 13 feet wide.  The runestone is flat and slab -like, with uneven edges.  The surface is cracked and split in two diagonally, leaning backwards at a slight inclined angle.
She clears some more of the dirt clinging to the rock, and takes some scrap parchment from her pack.  She creates a parchment rubbing of a small design in the corner of a figure riding a horse.  She is frustrated that she can’t copy the entire script because she doesn’t have any more parchment.  As she finishes and tries to decipher the letters, she hears something moving in the distance.  

She turns and picks up her pack, then takes a few cautious steps to look for the source of the sounds.  Over the ridge of the hill, she sees something moving in the undergrowth.  She quickly moves behind the nearest tree to peer out from the side.  As the creature gets closer, she ducks behind the tree to hide and waits for the creature to pass.

### Notes
Moss grows on the north side of trees, which can be used for navigating

Possibly have moths come out when the vines are pushed aside

Easter egg: have a rock formation that looks troll-like in appearance
