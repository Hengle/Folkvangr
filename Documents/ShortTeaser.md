*The trailer should be quick.  30 seconds max.  Atmospheric, Non-linear.  It will use some of the scenes that are listed in the [script](https://github.com/jcongerkallas1/Folkvangr/blob/master/Documents/script.mb) for the animated short.*

### Storyboard

Music begins to play.

Sequence 1: Establish the story conflict.

Fade out.

The main character raises a lantern to illuminate the darkness around her.  She appears small and alone in the middle of an endless forest. 

Cycle through a series of cinematic shots of the protagonist searching the forest.  Emphasize the environments and exploration aspect.  There will be a very loose sense of a story, but the visuals are the main focus of a teaser trailer.

Speed up editing, then cut to the title.  

Title Overlay Credits

The music should end with the title, so that the post credits scene is silent aside from the sound effects.

### Teaser Part 2: Cliffhanger
This short sequence takes place after the title appears.

The protagonist is running when she bursts into a clearing area, where she pauses to catch her breath look over her shoulder at the patch of trees behind her.  Pause for dramatic tension on the establishing shot of the treeline.  Rustling and snapping branches can be heard.  The creature suddenly bursts out of the trees.  

Final cutaway shot pans to follow the dynamic action as the protagonist resumes running as if her life depended on it, dodging branches and jumping over fallen logs.  The creature starts to bound after her at a much faster rate than she can sprint.

Sharp cut to end of teaser.  Info about the crowdfunding page and misc. website links will be displayed.
