### Cinematography

The cinematography for the attack scene is inspired by the velociraptor kitchen scene in *Jurassic Park* and the visceral bear attack scene in *The Revenant.*  The violence will be toned down slightly though.

The end sequence needs to elicit some kind of emotional reaction, but it shouldn't be melodramatic or a cliffhanger. The resolution of the story has both characters survive, leaving them to continue the adventure.  The next chapter would immediately jumps into having the characters interact with eachother, and explain what Heyward was up to while Regin was looking for him.  This sets up the reveal of the series of events that catalyzes the rest of the story.

### Costume Changes
Both character models emerge from the forest far more beat up than they went in.  Regin's costume will need to undergo weathering from mud, water, branches, and rain. Her appearance will shift from her outfit worn at the homestead to her hooded forest apparel.  In some scenes she will wear a hood, but when she lowers the hood her hair will be loose and tangled to indicate the stress she is under.

Bruises, blood, and scratches will need to be accounted for.

### Character Development
The main thing that needs to be conveyed in the brief intro is that the two siblings are foils of eachother.  She is pragmatic, determined, and hardworking, while he is not really committed to doing anything useful with his time.  Instead of harvesting crops for winter, he is wandering around in the forest, unlikely to actually catch anything.

Despite their differences, he is still her family, so she has an obligation to try and find him even when the other villagers won't risk their lives on his account.  

In the short, it would be difficult to convey any significant backstory without flashback sequences which are an unnecessary amount of extra work.  One thing that might work is if it is somehow made clear that her pendant necklace was a gift from her brother a long time ago, and she still wears it.  The pendant is old, made of pitted iron, and is kind of worn because it was buried in the ground. He gave the useless trinket to her because it had runes carved on it, and he knows she has an interest in old stuff.

### Theme

The story arc is about how the characters kind of start off being jerks to eachother because they are siblings, but this is resolved by Regin's sacrifices to try and help her brother.  He realizes that he was taking her for granted.

The ending is intended to subvert the objective of the story.  Regin's goal is to find her brother, but despite overcoming many obstacles, she technically fails to locate him.  She gives up in the end, but holds out the small hope that he will be alright when she symbolically puts the pendant in her hand.  However, when Heyward finds her, the realization what she did for him brings the characters closer together and shows that they actually care for each other very much.

Hopefully by the end of the short, after seeing the character go through a really rough time, it will make the audience have some empathetic reaction to her apparent death.  The audience expected her to find her brother in the end, not the other way around.

### Continuity
The ending of the short implies Regin could still be alive.  This will be left to the interpretation of the audience.

Canonically, she lives.

The events after the ending would be tied into the video game, if that gets made.  Heyward carries Regin out of the forest back to the homestead.  She recovers and immediately begins to berate him for his actions that nearly got her killed.  She demands to know what happened to him for the past few days, and why didn't he return.  He then explains his side of the story.
