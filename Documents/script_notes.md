### Cinematography

The cinematography for the attack scene is inspired by the Velociraptor scene in Jurassic Park and the visceral bear attack scene in The Revenant.

### Theme

The story arc is about how the characters kind of start off being jerks to eachother because they are siblings, but this is resolved by Regin's sacrifices to help her brother.

The ending is intended to subvert the objective of the story.  Regin's goal is to find her brother, but despite overcoming many obstacles, she technically fails to locate him.  However, when Heyward finds her, the realization what she did is a victory that brings the characters closer together and shows that they actually care for each other very much.

### Continuity

The canonical events after the ending would be tied into the video game.  Heyward carries Regin out of the forest back to the homestead.  She recovers and immediately begins to berate him for nearly scaring her to death.  She demands to know what happened to him for the past few days, and why didn't he return.  He then explains his side of the story.
