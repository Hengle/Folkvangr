### Cinematography

The cinematography for the attack scene is inspired by the Velociraptor scene in Jurassic Park and the visceral bear attack scene in The Revenant.

The ending is intended to subvert the objective of the story.  Regin's goal is to find her brother, but despite overcoming many obstacles, she technically fails to locate him.  However, when Heyward finds her, the realization what she did is a victory that brings the characters closer together and shows that they care for each other very much.
