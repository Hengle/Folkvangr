### Cinematography

The cinematography for the attack scene is inspired by the Velociraptor scene in Jurassic Park and the visceral bear attack scene in The Revenant.

The end sequence is similar to the end of Big Hero 6 when Hiro realizes what Baymax is planning to do.

### Character Development
The main thing that needs to be conveyed in the brief intro is that the two siblings are foils of eachother.  She is pragmatic, determined, and hardworking, while he is not really committed to doing anything useful with his time.  Instead of harvesting crops for winter, he is wandering around in the forest, unlikely to actually catch anything.

In the short, it would be difficult to convey any more backstory without flashbacks.

### Theme

The story arc is about how the characters kind of start off being jerks to eachother because they are siblings, but this is resolved by Regin's sacrifices to try and help her brother.  He realizes that he was taking her for granted.

The ending is intended to subvert the objective of the story.  Regin's goal is to find her brother, but despite overcoming many obstacles, she technically fails to locate him.  However, when Heyward finds her, the realization what she did is a victory that brings the characters closer together and shows that they actually care for each other very much.

### Setting
The homestead and search party are the oly real glimpses at the culture of the world.  Costume designs and architecture will need to reflect the agrarian society.  The constant background presense of old ruins and carved rune stones suggests that a more advanced ancient culture once existed, but has collapsed over time.

The forest setting is the first initial hint at the scale of the larger world.  It needs to convey a sense of awe, as well as a looming sense of fear or dread.  There are many beautiful settings, but the forest is also a dangerous place that can kill just as easily as it can inspire.  

If possible, it would be cool to incorporate the nature into the art style.  Rather than having static backgrounds, the environments would be constantly in motion and sort of alive through use of stylized linework filtered over the 3D backgrounds. 

Since so many scenes are just the character wandering in the forest, the backgrounds play an important role as a potential storytelling device.  Having the environments sway and shift makes the setting stand out more prominently than normal.  It is an equally important character in the story, as it represents nature as a netral force that can be an obstacle or an asset in certain instances.  It is always kind of there, looming in the background, impervious to the concerns of the living characters.

The level design will also play an important role in the action sequence, as the character has to use the environment to her advantage.  In this situation, the forest that has so far been a major hindrance to her search is now ironically helping keep her alive.

### Continuity

The canonical events after the ending would be tied into the video game.  Heyward carries Regin out of the forest back to the homestead.  She recovers and immediately begins to berate him for his actions that nearly got her killed.  She demands to know what happened to him for the past few days, and why didn't he return.  He then explains his side of the story.
