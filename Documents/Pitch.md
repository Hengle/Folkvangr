## Production Goals and Art Style
The goal is to produce an animated short/trailer. This can then be used as a proof of concept to pitch a crowdfunding campaign for a RPG style video game alpha. If it doesn't look like the funding goals will be met, the trailer can possibly be submitted to a festival screening instead.

The style and medium will be determined by the art team, but will likely employ 2D/3D hybrid techniques.

Emphasis will be placed on character animation, cinematography, story, and visual stylization.

## Trailer Synopsis

The story is set in an isolated hamlet bordered by a dense forest. When the local forester doesn’t return from an ill-advised hunting foray in the woods, a search party gathers to look for him. The villagers eventually give up and turn back, but the forester's half-sister ventures deeper into the heart of the forest to continue searching.

The introductory trailer is intended to establish the setting for a more in-depth game production, but the animated short will stand alone as a self-contained story.

## Project Breakdown
The projected length of the promotional trailer is two to eight minutes.

Depending on the size of the team and the budget, production of the short promotional trailer is anticipated to take around eight months to develop. Since unexpected production delays always happen, it’s probably realistic to add an extra few months to that number.

## Production Status
The project is currently in the later pre-production stages, moving into Pre-Viz modeling and blocking. There is a script, some concept art, breakdowns, and documentation that can be used for reference. However, alternative suggestions, redesigns, and creative input from others will be taken into consideration.

## Compensation

The project is being self-financed until a pitch can be made on Kickstarter. Nobody is expected to work for free or to commit long-term without compensation. Any funds raised from sponsors or crowdfunding patrons will go directly towards paying team members, minus taxes and expenses.

Contributors will retain full rights to their work if the project fails to meet completion.
