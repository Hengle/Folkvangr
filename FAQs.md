### Will the game be a true open world RPG?
The game will embrace classic RPG tactics and class systems, but it will focus more on a traditional narrative.  There will be some limits with exploring maps and there will not be a character creation system.

### What will the gameplay be like?
Combat will be faster paced so that players can play in real time or pause combat to plan tactics.  

The party will support 2-8 party members, but will generally be split up to into smaller 2-4 person teams.

Customization and exploration will be more limited, but the game levels and encounters will be crafted to be more balanced as a result.

Greater emphasis will be put on fleshing out the characters to be less generic than the typical roleplaying NPC.  

### Will there be online multiplayer?
Not likely.

### What makes this game different from other RPGs?
The setting will be based on historical research to simulate a post-Viking Age fantasy culture. The basis for the art style will include historical research intended to make the culture have a distinct look and feel. It won't look like a generic Elder Scrolls or WOW clone.

The game will focus on the narrative and the sense of creating an immersive experience rather than devoting time and resources to unnecessary features like lockpicking or stat micromanagement.  

### What is the story about?

The story follows two main protagonists, a brother and sister.  The characters' relationship and conflicts are the central point of the game.  Early on they accidentally discover a relic that attracts the attention of the antagonists and results in an exxtended game of cat and mouse as they are hunted across the land. 

The story is not about the characters needing to save the world from cataclysmic destruction.

### Features?

Stats will be balanced enough that there won't be a wrong way to build a certain class that makes progression of defeating bosses impossible.

Difficulty settings will be adjustable.  It is not another Dark Souls clone or roguelike game.

Sidequests will serve a purpose, have decent rewards and stories, and will not be grinding fetch quests.

The antagonists will be fleshed out as unique characters in the game, not just bosses encountered for the sake of a battle.

The story is not intended to be a grimdark misery fest.  There will be moments of humor to counterbalance the dramatic moments.
