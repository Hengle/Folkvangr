### What is the story about?

The story borrows elements from other media, but in many ways it also distances itself from feeling too similar to the usual tropes of a Medieval RPGs.  The story is not intended to ever develop into an epic where the characters must save the world from cataclysmic destruction.

### What makes the game different from other RPGs?

The game will focus on the narrative and the sense of creating an immersive experience rather than devoting time and resources to unnecessary features like lockpicking or stat micromanagement.  

Stats will be balanced enough that there won't be a wrong way to build a certain class that makes progression of defeating bosses impossible.

Difficulty settings will be adjustable.  It is not another Dark Souls clone or roguelike game.

Sidequests will serve a purpose, have decent rewards and stories, and will not be grinding fetch quests.

The basis for the art style will include historical research intended to make the culture have a distinct look and feel. It won't look like a generic WOW clone.

The antagonists will be fleshed out as unique characters in the game, not just bosses encountered for the sake of a battle.

The story is not intended to be a grimdark misery fest.  There will be moments of humor to counterbalance the dramatic moments.
