## Contributing
At this time, I am mainly just looking to find potential collaborators who might be interested in the project.  There are not any  formal commitments or obligatory contracts to sign.  Any form of help will be accredited.

I try to keep realistic expectations for what can be achieved with the available resources.  Without sufficient planning, support, or funding, the odds of completing a long-term project are slim.  

Unless certain key factors fall into place for raising funds to fairly compensate the team contributors, I will not ask other people to pour their time and energy into a high-risk project. 

## Milestones and Collaboration
I believe that the best ideas are usually the product of many different people contributing their creativity and ideas.  Hopefully that will prove true for this project.  

To avoid miserable experience of crunch and micromanagement, flexible milestones and stretch goals will be set prior to crowdfunding.

Dailies, a chatboard (Discord), Trello, and an alternating scrum system will help keep the project members updated and aware of progress.

## Payment
Terms will be negotiated privately.  At this point in time, most of my personal savings have already been used up, so full-time payment will only be feasible after crowdfunding.

## Studio and Remote Work
The project will be managed remotely.  I live in the middle of nowhere in North Carolina, far from any industry centers.  This means that software, artist tools, and studio space will be the contributor's responsibility, at least until there are a few core team members and a little budget money to go around.

If there is a chance to establish a physical studio space, it would be based in Atlanta or Raleigh in central NC, close to the headquarters for Epic Games.  A secondary unit in California, NY, Texas, or Canada might be more convenient for some team members.

Online communication channels will be set up for dailies, reviews, posts, and updates, but the lack of a central studio is definitely going to cause some slight inconveniences.  Apologies in advance.  I will do my best to make things work.

## Application
Please send a short cover letter with some of the things you might be interested in working on.  

Thanks for reading this far.  If there are any questions about the project, feel free to contact me by email.  I generally try to reply within 24 hours.
