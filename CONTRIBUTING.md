## Contributing
At this time, I am mainly looking to find potential collaborators who might be interested in the project.  There are no formal commitments or obligatory contracts to sign until the project is financed.  Any form of help will be accredited.

I try to keep realistic expectations for what can be achieved with the available resources.  Without sufficient planning, support, or funding, the odds of completing a long-term project are slim.  

Unless certain key factors fall into place for raising funds to fairly compensate the team contributors, I will not ask other people to pour their time and energy into a high-risk project. 

I believe that the best ideas are usually the product of many different people contributing their creativity and ideas.  Hopefully that will prove true for this project.  

## Application
Please send a cover letter with some of the things you might be interested in working on.  

Professional quality standards apply.  Good communication skills are probably the most important factor, as much of the work may be remote. 

Main positions will likely go to those with the most qualifications and experience, but I try not to flatly deny people who are willing to help out in some way.  There may be assistant positions available during certain points of the production.

Thanks for reading this far.  If there are any questions about the project, feel free to contact me by email.  I generally try to reply within 24 hours.
