## Contributing
At this time, I am mainly just looking to find potential collaborators who might be interested in the project.  There are not any  formal commitments or obligatory contracts to sign.  Any form of help will be accredited.

I try to keep realistic expectations for what can be achieved with the available resources.  Without sufficient planning, support, or funding, the odds of completing a long-term project are slim.  

Unless certain key factors fall into place for raising funds to fairly compensate the team contributors, I will not ask other people to pour their time and energy into a high-risk project.

## Milestones and Collaboration
I believe that the best ideas are usually the product of many different people contributing their creativity and ideas.  Hopefully that will prove true for this project.  

A chatboard [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/326900944862314506), [Trello](https://trello.com/b/b2Wf4KYK/folkvangr), and posts on Artella will help keep project members updated and aware of progress.

## Payment
Terms will be negotiated privately.  At this point in time, most of my personal savings have already been used up, so full-time payment will only be feasible after crowdfunding.

## Studio and Remote Work
The project will be managed remotely.  I live in the middle of nowhere in North Carolina, far from any industry centers.  This means that software, artist tools, and studio space will be the contributor's responsibility.

Online communication channels will be set up, but the lack of a central studio is definitely going to cause some slight inconveniences.  Apologies in advance.  I will do my best to make things work.

## Open Positions
Currently only pre-vis designers and project leads are needed.  However, any programmers, game artists, voice actors, etc. are welcome to get in contact or join the project.  Just be aware that there might not be much for technical positions to do until more assets have been developed.
