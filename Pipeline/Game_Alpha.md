The player will need to search for clues concerning a large runestone.  Common enemies and puzzles will serve as obstacles along the way.

The player will be guided by a pair of ravens.  Following the ravens will lead to unique puzzles and locations.  The birds can help lead the way when lost.

After beating the first boss, the player will find the ruins where the second player is trapped. This will set up the second boss fight.
