### Will the game be a true open world RPG?
The game will embrace classic RPG tactics and class systems, but it will focus more on a traditional narrative.  Due to the limits of funding and scope, there will be some limits with map sizes and graphics quality.  

The goal is to create compact well-designed maps rather than large open maps that feel kind of empty, in the vein of level design in Dark Souls or Dishonored.  Level sections will have unique visual usuals to distinguish from the other areas.

### What will the gameplay be like?
Combat will be faster paced so that players can play in real time or pause combat to plan tactics.  

The party will support 2-8 party members, but will generally be split up to into smaller 2-4 person teams.

Customization and exploration will be more limited, but the game levels and encounters will be crafted to be more balanced as a result.

Greater emphasis will be put on fleshing out the characters to be less generic than the typical roleplaying NPC.  

### Will there be online multiplayer?
Not likely.

### What makes this game different from other RPGs?
The setting will be based on historical research to simulate a post-Viking Age fantasy culture. The basis for the art style will be based heavily on historical research intended to make the culture have a distinct look and feel. It won't look like a knockoff Elder Scrolls game or WOW clone.

The game will focus on the narrative and the sense of creating an immersive experience rather than devoting time and resources to unnecessary features like lockpicking or stat micromanagement.  

### What is the story about?

The core story follows two main protagonists, a brother and sister.  The characters' relationship and conflicts are the central point of the game.  Early on they accidentally discover a relic that attracts the attention of the antagonists and results in an exxtended game of cat and mouse as they are hunted across the land. As in most RPGs, they travel to epic locations, add extra party members, and develop new abilities along the way.

### Features?

Stats will be balanced enough that there won't be a wrong way to build a certain class that makes progression of defeating bosses impossible.

Difficulty settings will be adjustable.  It is not another Dark Souls clone or roguelike game.

Sidequests will serve a purpose, have decent rewards and stories, and will not be grinding fetch quests.

The antagonists will be fleshed out as unique characters in the game, not just bosses encountered for the sake of a battle.

The story is not intended to be a grimdark misery fest.  There will be moments of humor to counterbalance the dramatic moments.

### Will content be cut?
Undoubtedly.  The current game outline would need to be split into at least three parts to be remotely feasible for a small team to ever hope to complete.  More editing will reduce the game to a manageable scale if there is more progress made towards that goal.  For now, the animated trailer is the main focus.
