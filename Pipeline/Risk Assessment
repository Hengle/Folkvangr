## Pipeline Known Challenges

The biggest challenges are going to be Animation, AI, and Assets.

To make the scope of the project manageable, much of the combat will likely need to be based on stats rather than animated combat.

The game needs to use a clever new combat system to make the gameplay interesting, without requiring hundreds of inventory items, armor sets, or assets.

The game needs to be approached from a minimalist stance.  Anything that is unnecessary, even if it is cool, needs to be cut.  If it doesn't serve the story or core gameplay, cut it.

Reducing the quality of graphics will be necessary from a practical point of view.  Physics, texturing, and 3D lighting are not things an indie team want to deal with.

AI for enemies could prove challenging.

Some combat me need to be substituted for puzzles, since there is no way all the variety of enemies will make it into the game.

Reuse animations, character models, and types of stats.  Create a library of core stats that can be mixed to create different enemy and player movesets and abilities that feel different enough to still be interesting.

Maybe try procedural generation for enemy spawn or skill types.

Begin planning art and design before beginning pre-production.  The art style and medium need to be established before programming anything, or the project will stall out.

Gating will be used to limit level progression and exploration appropriately.  Multi-pathing options should help levels feel less linear.
