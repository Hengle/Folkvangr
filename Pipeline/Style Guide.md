### Art Style
The art style for the game has yet to be established.  It is anticipated that character models will need to be 3D, but a stylized illustrated look is preferred.  The graphics and textures will not be next-gen simply due to budget and time limitations.

Possible design influences include Telltale Games, The Secret of Kells, and The Banner Saga.  Narratively, this game will be very different from these titles.

Historical reference will be used for inspiration for tools, weapons, costumes, architecture, and other designs.

### Pipeline Model
Ideally want to avoid Crunch as much as possible, especially in the early development cycle.
Preplanning as much as possible will hopefully cut down on wasted time, redesigns, and redundancies.
