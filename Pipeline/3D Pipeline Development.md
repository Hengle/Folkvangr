## Pipeline Overview

Some assets will be reused or tweaked in subsequent levels.  To maximize proficiency, certain assets will need to be produced first before moving on to custom or low-priority features.

Agile development is expected to be used for completing stretch goals.  Stretch goals will cycle between check in, review, test/implement, repeat.  Scrum masters will be assigned on a rotating shift if necessary, but are propbably not necessary starting out.

For the trailer proof of concept, only the essentials for a minimum viable product are needed.

For the first production cycle, a vertical slice alpha will be needed. This means assets for areas 1-3 will be the main focus.  Some areas may be less complete than others, and bugs will be ironed out in future iterations and testing.
