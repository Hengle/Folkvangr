## Application
Please send a cover letter with some of the things you might be interested in working on. 

Name:

Preferred Contact (Optional)

List any software skills, preferred art medium, or other relevant experience and skills.  It doesn't need to be a formal CV.

What role are you interested in?


Professional quality standards apply.  Good communication skills are probably the most important factor, as much of the work may be remote. 

Main positions will likely go to those with the most qualifications and experience, but I try not to flatly deny people who are willing to help out in some way.  There may be assistant positions available during certain points of the production.

Thanks for reading this far.  If there are any questions about the project, feel free to contact me by email.  I generally try to reply within 24 hours.
