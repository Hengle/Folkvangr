## Non-Disclosure Agreement

Note the NDA does not really need to be signed until after the crowdfunding campaign.  Please disregard this page if reading before then.

I'm not really a big fan of NDAs or the constraints they place on production crews, so if they can potentially be avoided, that might happen.  Spoilers and early negative reviews aren't exactly a major concern since the game would be completed in installments. The main goal is to be transparent and avoid bad press.
