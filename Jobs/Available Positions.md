# Production Leads

### Director/Co-Director
**Role:** The Director/s bring an original vision for the realization of the project.  Co-Directors will collaborate and compromise with the other production leads while encouraging the team to make their best possible end-product.  This is a professional project, but the goal is not to create a for-profit corporate studio system with bureaucracy and micromanagent. Good leadership qualities, time management, and communication skills are necessary for directing roles. Egos and creative differences will need to be put aside for the best interests of the project and team. 

**Requirements:** Preferably have a background in animation, VFX, or game development.  

### Production Designer/ Art Director
**Role:** The Art Director's role is to craft a coherent visual language for the production, and to ensure artists and animators produce work conforming to the style guides and quality standards.  The art director will also be responsible for dailies and collaborating with the art and technical team regularly.  Team management requires a lot of time investment, so if the Art Director wants to have greater involvement in the creative process, the job terms are negotiable.

**Requirements:** Portfolio and Good Communication Skills. An interest in art history would be a bonus.

### Technical Director/Head of Animation
**Role:** Oversees the technical aspects of the animation pipeline, namely layout, rigging, texturing, lighting, rendering, and FX.  This role may be divided among a number of leads if necessary to break up the workload.

**Requirements:** Experience with animation software and studio workflow methods.  Game industry experience preferable.
