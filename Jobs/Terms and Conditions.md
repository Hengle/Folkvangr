### Obligations and Commitments

Until a NDA contract is signed, there are no pressures, obligations, or long-term commitments. This is intended to lower the risks of burnout or contracting Unfinished Indie Project Syndrome.  People can leave or rejoin the project at any time, though prior notification of departure is a common courtesy.

Professional quality standards apply.  Good communication skills are probably the most important factor, as much of the work may be remote.

### Required Experience

Main paid positions will likely go to those with the right skills for the job.  In most cases this will boil down to portfolios, qualifications, and experience, but I try not to flatly deny people who are willing to help out in some way.  

There may be assistant or junior-level positions available during certain points of the production. 

### Artist Rights

With the exception of paid freelance services, all rights to artwork and code will revert to the original authors if the crowdfunding campaign does not raise the necessary amounts.

Any designs or concept artwork that is not used in the final product, merchandise, or for promotional purposes will revert back to the original author.

Contributors may display artwork on their personal portfolios.  It is preferable that permission be asked first if displaying images that might compromise key story details or gameplay features during ongoing production.

### Contracts
Individuals can always request or negotiate terms or contracts.

A Non-Disclosure agreement may be used during official production after the first crowdfunding campaign.  This may not be required.

Artists may be asked to sign a permission form to allow use of cetain production designs for rewards in crowdfunding campaigns.

### Music Rights

Music will be attributed under a royalty free license.

### Creative Commons
Assets may be donated to Creative Commons if desired.

### Attribution
All contributors will be credited in promotional releases and the final product.

### Revenue Share
Revenue share models are generally not an ideal method of compensation, but if employees want to negotiate for percentage shares of the profits, that may be an option.  Contributors will receive a revenue share proportional to the amount of work they do on the project.

### Liability
Contributors are responsible for keeping up with the most recent terms.  Notifications will usually be sent out if there are any major changes.  By working on the project, it is assumed the individual accepts the conditions.
