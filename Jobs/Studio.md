### Studio Name
Undecided.

### Studio Size
The core team will likely be 6-12 people starting out.  A network of freelance and industry contacts will be needed for support.

### Studio Location
Atlanta looks to be one of the best markets for film and animation on the East Coast of the United States. It also is relatively close to major universities like SCAD.

### Studio Goals
If established, the studio's long term goals will be to focus on producing story-driven shorts and adult-oriented animation, most likely for commercials and animated trailers.  The studio will emphasize multimedia and hybrid technology rather than pure 3D animation.

### Niche Audience
The studio will appeal to the market for adult oriented animation moreso than children's entertainment or commercial ventures.  The studio will focus on telling stories and impliment different visual styles for each project.  Individual artists will be given more opportunity to express personal styles, an aspect missing from many blockbuster productions.

The goal is to avoid being limited by franchises or expensive to produce VFX-heavy productions.  Each project will be approached as a new challenge. 

The difficult part is making quality animation economically without access to the large budgets or tools of other studios.

Advertising will also take some work to attract clients.

### Pipeline
The studio atmosphere will be more relaxed and informal than a large studio.  The goal is to create a pipeline without stiffling micromanagement where employees are respected and entrusted with a greater degree of creative freedom.  

Deadlines tend to be shorter in the commercial world, so there may still be some real-world limitations.  Dailies and deliverables would serve to keep everyone updated and on track.

### Startup Costs
Studio Rent, Local Cost of Living, Equipment, Etc.  The amount of investment revenue will be determined by the earnings of the successful release of the game.

Realistic implementation will require baby steps and a lot of monetary investment.  Maybe with a successful product release and some other smaller projects, a small studio might be feasible in a few years.

### Budget
The company will need to earn at least $150,000-350,000 each year.  The bulk of this will probably come from supplimental revenue from smaller commercial commission projects, with investments in larger projects hopefully allowing gradual expansion into better markets like feature animation, television, or game development. 

### Studio Ownership
Rights to the studio and associated IP assets will belong to the core members as determined by contract.  Ownership will be need to be limited and clearly defined in contracts to avoid undesirable legal disputes between partners.

Studio earnings will be calculated from net profits.
