## Application
Applications and interviews can be a pain, so to make this process as painless as possible, just send an intro email or message with any questions if interested.

**Name:**

**Preferred Email or Alternate Means of Contact:**

**What project role are you interested in?**

**Attach portfolio images or a link to a portfolio or online resume.**


## Possible Followup Interview Questions
Below are some things that might optionally be nice to include in a cover letter if desired.  I'm just looking for a basic introduction so I can get a better idea of some of the things you might be interested in working on. 

It is preferable to avoid sending generic template resumes and long CVs, but if sent I'll take a look at them anyway.

**List any software skills, preferred style/medium, or other relevant experience and skills.**

**(Optional) General Regional Location/Time Zone:**

**(Optional) Schedule/Hours Available?**

**(Optional) Relevent Interests, Hobbies?**


## Contact
If there are any questions about the project, feel free to contact me by email.  I generally try to reply within 48 hours.
