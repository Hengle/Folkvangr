## Application
Please send a cover letter with some of the things you might be interested in working on. 


**Name:**

**Preferred Email or Alternate Means of Contact (Optional):**

**(Optional) General Regional Location:**

**List any software skills, preferred art medium, or other relevant experience and skills.  It doesn't need to be a formal CV.**

**Attach portfolio images or a link to a portfolio or online resume.**

**What role are you interested in?**

**Interests, Hobbies?**

**(Optional) Hours Available, Other Projects, Careers, or Life Commitments that the project manager should be aware of?**

**(Optional) What is one thing that you think you can uniquely contribute to the project that nobody else can?**

**(Optional) Any critical initial feedback on the project, positive or negative?  ex. Does the scope seem too ambitious, are there major changes you would make to the story, gameplay, or characters, things to add or cut to improve the concept, etc.**

## Terms

Until a NDA contract is signed, there are no pressures, obligations, or long-term commitments. This is intended to lower the risks of burnout or contracting Unfinished Indie Project Syndrome.  People can leave or rejoin the project at any time, though prior notification of departure is a common courtesy.

Professional quality standards apply.  Good communication skills are probably the most important factor, as much of the work may be remote.

## Required Experience

Main paid positions will likely go to those with the right skills for the job.  In most cases this will boil down to portfolios, qualifications, and experience, but I try not to flatly deny people who are willing to help out in some way.  There may be assistant positions available during certain points of the production, with opportunities for compensation or networking.


## Contact
Thanks for reading this far.  If there are any questions about the project, feel free to contact me by email.  I generally try to reply within 48 hours.
