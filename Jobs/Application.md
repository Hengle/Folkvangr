## Application
People are generally busy and applications and interviews can be a pain, so to make this process as painless as possible, just send an intro email or message with any questions if interested.

**Name:**

**Preferred Email or Alternate Means of Contact:**

**What role are you interested in?**


## Possible Followup Interview Questions
Below are some things that might optionally be nice to include in a cover letter if desired.  I'm just looking for a basic introduction so I can get a better idea of some of the things you might be interested in working on. 

It is preferable to avoid sending generic template resumes and long CVs, but if sent I'll take a look at them anyway.

**List any software skills, preferred art medium, or other relevant experience and skills.**

**Attach portfolio images or a link to a portfolio or online resume.**

**Interests, Hobbies?**

**(Optional) General Regional Location:**

**(Optional) What aspect of the project sounds most interesting to you?**

**(Optional) Hours Available, Other Projects, Careers, or Life Commitments that the project manager should be aware of?**

**(Optional) Any critical initial feedback on the project, positive or negative?  ex. Does the scope seem too ambitious, are there major changes you would make to the story, gameplay, or characters, things to add or cut to improve the concept, etc.**


## Contact
If there are any questions about the project, feel free to contact me by email.  I generally try to reply within 48 hours.
