## Application
People are generally busy and applications and interviews can be a pain, so to make this process as painless as possible, just send an intro email or message with any questions if interested.

Below are some things that might optionally be nice to include in a cover letter if desired.  I'm just looking for a basic description of some of the things you might be interested in working on. Please don't send generic resume templates.

**Name:**

**Preferred Email or Alternate Means of Contact:**

**What role are you interested in?**

**List any software skills, preferred art medium, or other relevant experience and skills.  It doesn't need to be a formal CV.**

**Attach portfolio images or a link to a portfolio or online resume.**

**Interests, Hobbies?**

**(Optional) General Regional Location:**

**(Optional) Hours Available, Other Projects, Careers, or Life Commitments that the project manager should be aware of?**

**(Optional) What is one thing that you think you can uniquely contribute to the project that nobody else can?**

**(Optional) Any critical initial feedback on the project, positive or negative?  ex. Does the scope seem too ambitious, are there major changes you would make to the story, gameplay, or characters, things to add or cut to improve the concept, etc.**


## Contact
If there are any questions about the project, feel free to contact me by email.  I generally try to reply within 48 hours.
