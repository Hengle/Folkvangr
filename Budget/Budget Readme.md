## Budget Readme
The budget will likely undergo significant revision closer to a crowdfunding campaign date.  Current proposal amounts may not be accurate.

Flexible milestones and stretch goals will be adjusted prior to crowdfunding.

[Crowdfunding Stretch Goals](https://github.com/jcongerkallas1/Folkvangr/blob/master/Budget/Stretch%20Goals.md)

## Fundraising
The crowdfunding goal is estimated around $8,000-15,000 to create a game alpha for the first chapter (Levels 1-2).  The ultimate goal is to crowdfund the game in two or three incremental stretches, like an episodic game.  Each campaign will leverage the funding scope according to how the development is progressing, and what assets and features are being produced.  

Milestone markers and community updates would be scheduled to occur at regular intervals during development.  A conservative estimate for a small team producing a full game would likely take three or more years to finish.

## Funding Amount
The funding goals will be adjusted to the scope of the project and the collective experience of the team.

$30,000 is a more reasonable scope for a small indie team.

$400,000+ assumes prior establishment of a studio, pipeline, experienced developers, and other overhead costs.

## Risk Mitigation

Attempting to produce an entire alpha game is impractical until a trailer is ready and showing promising signs of being funded.  The plan is to focus on breaking the project down into smaller chunks so that the goals are achievable.  This way contributors can make smaller commitments, and there is less of a loss if the project doesn't work out.

If things progress well with the trailer and networking, preliminary discussions will begin for assembling a technical lead, director, management crew, and game development team.  The team commitments will need to be finalized several months before the crowdfunding campaign begins.

## Contingency Plan
If the fundraising campaign doesn't meet the first goal, other alternatives may be explored. 

The most likely option will be to submitting the animated short to festivals.
