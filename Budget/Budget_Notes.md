## Notes
The likelihood of success is small without having veteran involvement.  Hiring professionals at industry rates will significantly raise the costs of production

Need to reach 20% of funding in first 48 hours to have chance of success.

### Conservative Estimate: 
$8,000- 15,000 to produce a demo, trailer, or alpha
$300,000- $450,000 is the funding goal for full-time development of a game.
$100,000-200,000 might be the more realistic amount

This number is far short of what it actually costs to hire full time professionals.
$1.5- 3 million+ is the actual cost for an industry-standard project

The studio size will need to be small to stay within the budget.  The more crew, the more expenses.

Crowdfunding is tax deductable as a business, but sales tax may still apply

To produce the game will require professional facilities and equipment.  It is unlikely an independent campaign will raise enough extra funds for this

Need to network to find sponsors

Wages need to factor in cost of living.  Cost of Living is higher than $70,000 in some big city areas.

Production will take at least 2-3 years if the game is not edited down.

Need at least an 8 person team.  A team of 10-25 would be ideal.
