The following is a theoretical model for a studio.  Likelihood of it actually taking off remains pretty small. It would require a lot of financial security and investment.

### Studio Name
Undecided.  Maybe something to do with moths.  Moths are cool.

### Studio Size
The core team will likely be 8-12 people starting out.  A network of freelance and industry contacts will be needed for support.

### Studio Location
If there is a chance to establish a physical studio space, it would be based in Atlanta or Raleigh in central NC, close to the headquarters for Epic Games.  A secondary unit in California, NY, Texas, or Canada might be more convenient for some team members.

Atlanta looks to be one of the best markets for film and animation on the East Coast of the United States. It also is relatively close to major universities like SCAD.

### Studio Goals and Revenue Generation
If established, the studio will need to generate a constant flow of stable income for all employees.  Possible long term goals would likely focus on producing small-scope indie games, experimental story-driven shorts, or animated content that strives to go in a different direction.  

Freelance commissions for commercials and animated trailers might be a option.  The studio will emphasize multimedia and hybrid technology rather than pure 3D animation.  

### Proprietary Software
Most studios generate a large portion of income through internal software and technology development.  This is easier said than done, especially when competing against established companies with better funding.

### Niche Audience
A lot rests on whether the proposed video game sells well or not.  If the game doesn't overcome the sunk cost fallacy, then there likely won't be a future in the game design market.

The goal is to avoid being limited by franchises or expensive to produce VFX-heavy productions.  Each project will be approached as a new challenge. Perhaps with a rotating slate of directors.  This is a risky business model, so the studio will need safeguards and other means of generating revenue.

The studio would ideally appeal to the market for serious animation moreso than children's entertainment or commercial ventures.  The studio will focus on telling stories and impliment different visual styles for each project.  Individual artists will be given more opportunity to express personal styles, an aspect missing from many blockbuster productions.  

The difficult part is making quality animation economically without access to the large budgets or tools of other studios.

Advertising will also take some work to attract clients.

### Office Space
It would be nice to build contacts in the open source community and keep the studio true to the creative roots rather than become a money-driven business.

The office space should be fun.  No cubicles or windowless prisons.  Lots of wall space for posting artwork.  A comfortable area for meetings.

Benefits, insurance, vacation time, 9:00-5:00 hours, weekends off.  

### Pipeline
The studio atmosphere will be more relaxed and informal than a large studio.  The goal is to create a pipeline without stiffling micromanagement or crunch, where employees are respected and entrusted with a greater degree of creative freedom.  

Deadlines tend to be shorter in the commercial world, so there may still be some real-world limitations.  Dailies and deliverables would serve to keep everyone updated and on track.

### Startup Costs
Studio Rent, Local Cost of Living, Equipment, Etc.  The amount of investment revenue will be determined by the earnings of the successful release of the game.

Realistic implementation will require baby steps and a lot of monetary investment.  Maybe with a successful product release and some other smaller projects, a small studio might be feasible in a few years.

Monthly costs for a 12 person team is estimated around $40,000, excluding studio rental.

### Development Schedule
Ideas for future projects can be decided by the team. 1-2 full games should be in development at any given time, with smaller productions supplementing income to cover operation expenses.  Networking with production studios is essential to secure deals and funds.

### Budget
The company will need to earn at least $150,000-350,000 each year to cover salaries, equipment costs, licensing, etc.  The bulk of this will probably come from supplimental revenue from smaller commercial commission projects, with investments in larger projects hopefully allowing gradual expansion into better markets like feature animation, television, or game development. 

### Studio Ownership
Rights to the studio and associated IP assets will belong to the core members as determined by contract.  Ownership will be need to be limited and clearly defined in contracts to avoid undesirable legal disputes between partners.

Studio earnings will be calculated from net profits.
