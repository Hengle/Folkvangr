### Campaign Expenses
- Advertising- Need to reach 20% of funding in first 48 hours to have chance of success

- Promotional Materials Manufacturing  

- Accountant  

- Crowdfunding Fees- Around 5-8% of raised amount, may have Federal income tax deductions as well (business account must be separate from personal income)

- IRS 1099-K tax form for anything over $20,000

- Sales Tax

- Rewards- cut costs by not going overboard with 3D Prints, keychains, posters, bumper stickers,etc.  The fewer physical rewards, the better.


### Campaign Goals
Conservative Estimate: $8,000- 15,000 to produce a demo, trailer, or alpha version of the game

$300,000- $450,000 is the funding goal for full-time development of a game.  Note, this number is far short of what it actually costs to hire full time professionals.

High-Budget Estimate: $1.5- 3 million is the actual cost for an industry-standard three year project.  This is not realistic for the scope of a crowdfunded indie game.

### Production Crew
- Director 

- Production Designer 

- Art Director  

- Lead Programmer  

- Animators- 3  

- Programmers- 3  

- Artists- 3

### Production
- Staff- 20 person team  

- 2-3 year development  

- License rights for software

### Veteran Involvement
The likelihood of success is small without having professional involvement.  Hiring professionals at industry rates  will significantly raise the costs of production.  A minimum of 300k per year for a team of around 20, 460k for $20 wages.

### Studio Sponsorship
To produce the game will require professional facilities and equipment. It is unlikely an independent campaign will raise enough extra funds for this, so a studio may be needed to produce and distribute the game. This will require some networking.
