### Product Release
If the game alpha receives backing or shows signs of selling decently, there may be an opportunity to continue the game more in the lines of a traditional RPG. The story could be relayed in an incremental episodic format.  Planning would need to account for establishing a full-time studio with a core team of developers.  If the budget does not meet the required numbers, then these plans will just have to be scrapped.
