## Game Mechanics
The core gameplay mechanic relies on possession of a magical artifact allowing the player to control wraiths with different abilities for a limited duration.  These abilities will be used in combat and puzzles.

The party system will allow the player to control 4-8 characters for planning out strategic combos or real time combat.  Certain battles will play out easier in real time, while unbalanced battles may require more strategy and resource management.

There will also be the standard power ups and armors that offer boosts to different abilities.

## Focus
The core focus will be on creating a game that is thoughtfully crafted, challenging, and fun.

Many indie games have shortcomings when too much focus is put on the art direction to the detriment of the actual gameplay controls.  Hopefully that can be avoided by putting equal emphasis on refining the basic movement and controls before adding in extra features.

Try to keep the game length manageable.  Any features that are not absolutely essential should be cut, and not add superfluous padding.

## Balance
Unlike most video games that provide lots of customization, power-ups, armor sets, and leveling, the game will keep the base power levels scaled throughout. Leveling will unlock extra abilities options and access to more powerful items, but players will not be overpowered relative to certain enemy types.  So if a player is facing three bandits or an armored opponent, the opponents will have a distinct advantage, but they can still be beaten by skill.  The playable characters are not super-powered or larger than life, so their abilities are kept believable.  They won't mow through hundreds of expendable grunts without using magical artifacts or unique weapons.

Factions will be balanced by a ranking system reflecting real world military classes and attack types.  If facing an opponent wearing plate armor with only a bow and arrow, the player will need to update their character's weapon to 

Bosses will likely be the exception to the rule, and will have higher health and attack.

## Difficulty
Saving will be allowed at giant waystones and other unique regional markers, with automatic saves at certain stages in the game.  This leaves the game open to casual players.  If others want to play on more difficult settings, there may be settings and optional limits to make combat more challenging.   Playing on difficult mode may lead to higher drop rates of better equipment and unique awards.

Want to make the game fair to all types of players.  Some parts may be challenging, but they should never be unfairly punishing or completely unbalanced.

## Encounters
Once enemies are killed, they will not respawn for a set number of hours.  Bosses do not respawn.

Enemies will have set levels in specific regions, but some may level to the highest ranking character.  Enemies will drop XP and items according to class type.  Unique items will drop from the more difficult enemies by a random counter.

Hit counters will determine how much damage to inflict based on the area where an attack strikes.  Limbs detract less than the head and torso.

## Map Size
The maps will not be expansive open worlds, though there will be hub areas and explorable areas.

Levels will be crafted in a way that they appear larger than they are.  Instead of using invisble borders, there might be cliffs, bogs, mountains, thorns, or walls to block off inaccessible areas.

Total map size will be less than 3x3 miles, with densely packed content and objectives so the world doesn't feel too empty.  

Smaller world size allows more attention to be placed on crafting interesting details, rather than generic modular componets and procedurally generated landscapes.

## Travel
Hub areas will allow quick travel options, but after leaving the area to progress to the next area the hub will not be accessible.

Early in the game, travel will be slower. In the later game, large areas will be traversed by mount or fast travel.

## Level Design
Level design will be set up to have multiple options for staging combat.  Magic attacks or stealth will play out differently, and may be less effective in some situations, keeping the player on their toes at all times.

Game levels will need to be designed to be compact and linear, while still giving some degree of freedom for exploration and alternate paths.

Game combat will be set up to follow tile maps and dungeons.

Enemies will spawn randomly in certain areas, but will have a set number in hub locations. 

## Side Quests
Grinding and fetch quests will not be a major focus of the game.  Side quests and instances will be integrated in the game as appropriate to the narrative.  The flow of the main story should not be interrupted at urgent points so that the player can spend hours gathering firewood for an NPC.

NPCs will award items based on their social status, so nobles and merchants will offer better wares than peasants.  However, assisting the needy will boost other skill areas and reputation more than mercenary work.

## UI
The menu will allow access to settings and stats

UI will display a world map and local area map, health bar, inventory, and quick select options

## Replayability
Considering options for difficulty modes, unlockable quests, collectible items, or an arena mode to extend gameplay lifespan

## Minigames
Potentially create working version of an in-universe strategic board game for crowdfunding campaign.  Creating a mini game requires less complex programming to set up than an alpha of the full game. 

Minigames and puzzles will not play as large of a role in the gameplay, but it may be optional to unlock extra items.
