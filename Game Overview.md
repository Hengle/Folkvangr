### Logline

Synopsis: Two siblings with little in common find themselves on a quest to right an unjust fate that denies souls from entering the halls of the dead. 

In terms of game style, picture if Rohan from *The Lord of the Rings* was the setting of a full video game, with the exploration and party system of an old school RPG.

### Game Overview

Instead of basing the narrative on a modernized reinterpretation of Ragnarok, Asgard, or another tale of larger than life heroes saving the world, the game would focus on fleshing out the other lesser known aspects of Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon mythology and cultures.  The art style and themes will be loosely based on evidence from archaeological excavations and accounts such as the *Prose Edda.*  

The game will touch upon technology, social status, warfare, superstition, and bardic storytelling.  Decisions are in the player's hands as they progress through levels.  There will be plentiful options for customizing class builds and skill trees.
