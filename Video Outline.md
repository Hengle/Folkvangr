## Script

Fade in Logo Design- Triple interwoven Gripping beast motif, not Ouroboros(too overused, maybe use it for forsundr logo)

Music swells

Need camera shot with my art books in the background, along with cool stuff.

Need Storyboard shot of female protagonist and the crowd of peasants, silhouettes.. Need to integrate more dynamic movement and animation, not just static images.  Or create a lot of very small rough colorscript thumbnails and put them on a board so people can't really see the closeup details (maybe brett would be interested?)  Need to finish script first

Explain the Concept: An animated short teaser trailer for a Norse-stye narrative about .  Heavily inspired by history, archaeology, and mythology, namely the Prose Edda and Landnamasbok and European myths and folklore.

I guess if I had to summarize the overarching theme of the story, it is ultimately about the characters finding their place of what makes them happy.  Not about being famous or the bravest.  Thematically linked to a saga, which was intended to tell the life story, good and bad.  moreso the Silmarillion than the Lord of the Rings, catalogs the fall of societies with these ancient ruins just lying around crumbling everywhere, there's a sense of fate that everything inevitably fades in time, and having to learn how to let go and accept change

Why the characters are interesting, traits, what are their goals- surrounded by thes giant statues and reminded of the legacy of these larger than life heroes who are their ancestors, yet they are just average people with no extraordinary skills or traits.  Interesting because the past is forgotten so easily, and there's this looming question of whether anything the protagonists do really matters.  Are their names going to be remembered in songs?

Really attempting to recreate an authentic atmosphere

Focus on pitching the trailer, not the game.  The goal is to produce a trailer.  Also not trying to gain money at this point, looking for collaborators

Why This pitch is different

Story Driven

Visual influences- 

Why should it matter to the Artella community
Willing to implement experimental technologies and techniques that improve animation efficiency
Will donate software, documentation, post-mortems, pipeline tools developed to the community
Free Assets Libraries
Creative freedom, 
Non- corporate studio with collaboration and respect for ideas

Game mechanics that encourage player to use strategy

Why should people invest in it/join project

Emphasis team and ability to be creative, no micromanagement

Possibly make an rpg board game or card game instead- higher likelihood of success

The Project- minimum viable product, trailer for pitch

Keep it fun and short, not boring

Have a pipeline, script, storyboard, and documentation for the game

I will be assisting the project as a production manager, writer, 3D modeler

Shoutout to all the artists who helped get this pitch started.  Wouldn't have been possible otherwise.  Links to their portfolios below.
